# Project DeViridi
In disaster times, many issues are cause impacting everyday life. From city infrastructure to the transport of goods. These problems limit a country or regionâ€™s ability to recover and adapt to the new surroundings. For this project, three aspects will be focused upon:
Delivery of Supplies: Many supplies (e.g. food) are required to be stored and delivered under harsh conditions. This is vital for recovery, hence solutions to help store and monitor these supplies are required to ensure everyone receives the necessary supplies they need. Additionally, many businesses fail to communicate with users about their stock and have issues with security (e.g. looting).
Mobility : Disasters often damage infrastructure, such as roads and pavements, and can even cause flooding. In order to help temporarily fix these issues (e.g. potholes) an adaptable solution is required to reduce the effects of the disaster. 
Communication & Connection: Information and communication is a huge issue with disasters, with little access to WIFI preventing people from keeping updated and accessing information. Many disasters rely upon environmental data to determine safety, and this should be updated and communicated with the public.
